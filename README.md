# [The Category of `Mod`](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Mod)

I defined the category of modules at [here](src/cats.lean#L92) following the link above.
This may or may not be useful to define sheaf of modules.

# Sheaf of Modules

There is also a formalisation of sheaf of modules at [here](src/cats.lean#L20). But there
might be a fancier definition using the category of `Mod`.
